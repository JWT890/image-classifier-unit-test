Currently working on unit testing of Simple Image Classifier in a Vue app. Current trying to resolve an error relating
to the classification part of with it with fetch to determine if the picture is 50/50 dog or cat. Current error message
is ReferenceError: fetch is not defined on line 28 in the SimpleImageClassifier.vue application. Spent a couple hours Monday
resolving it but was not working in the original repo as part of a testing environment. Will continue to find a solution
through looking around and asking Bard and ChatGPT for assistance.
