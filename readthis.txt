The error saying SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
seems to have been resolved by adding transformIgnorePatterns and transform
to the package.json under jest. This seems to have worked and is now showing
the unit test results by saying something about toBe on lines 24 and 15 on
the unit test portion. This is the case because the code itself is a 
Math.random function of 50/50 and flips back and forth between cat and dog
labels even when its not a cat or dog. Will see if I can improve
the code if needed so as to have a successful unit test even if the code
itself is a proof of concept.
