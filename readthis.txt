The error saying SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
seems to have been resolved by adding transformIgnorePatterns and transform
to the package.json under jest. This seems to have worked and is now showing
the unit test results by saying something about toBe on lines 24 and 15 on
the unit test portion. This is the case because the code itself is a 
Math.random function of 50/50 and flips back and forth between cat and dog
labels even when its not a cat or dog. Will see if I can improve
the code if needed so as to have a successful unit test even if the code
itself is a proof of concept.

Changed the toBe function to toBeTruthy to make it more on par with the code
since its a Math.random function at the end. When changing and testing the code
a new error when unit testing occured, expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality, 
and when changing toBe(true) to toBe(false), Cannot call text on an empty DOMWrapper. 
This was done to fix the respective errors in the unit test. When testing now with
toBeTruthy, an error appears saying expect(received).toBeTruthy Received: false. This
error is likely in correlation to Math.random or just with toBeTruthy. Even with this,
there is a successful unit test when rendering the element. An idea to be had is unit testing
a Vue calculator application or unit testing beginner project videos.
